## Week 1 Instructions

Files are to be submitted to the Culminating Task -- Week 1 Dropbox at the end of the week. Submit every written document as a PDF file.

The Week 1 Dropbox closes at Jan 13 at 11:59 PM. If you have not submitted everything by then, you will have to submit the rest later in the Culminating Task -- Week 2 Dropbox. It is a group Dropbox, so you can see what your teammates have submitted. Update: I forgot to change it to a group Dropbox and now I can't change the settings since there are submissions. Sorry about that! The next Dropboxes will be group Dropboxes so that you can see what your teammates have submitted.
