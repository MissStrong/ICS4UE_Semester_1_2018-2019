## Object-Oriented Programming

**Object-oriented programming** (OOP) is a programming methodology that involves separating a program into separate modules.

There are other programming methodologies besides OOP. **Sequential programming** invovles executing a program line-by-line, in order. **Procedural programming** involves creating functions (i.e. methods, in Java) that perform routines and can be called at any point in a program. You have been using all three methodologies in this course.


### Class Hierarchy

In order to use OOP to its highest potential, it is important to understand the different ways in which a class can interact with another class. There are three types of relationships classes can have: **aggregation**, **composition**, and **inheritance**.
